    <h2>Lane Tech Cheer Booster Club Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>
      The boosters' mission is to support and promote Lane Tech's Varsity cheer program by fostering school spirit, encouraging community involvement, and providing financial and volunteer resources that empower our athletes to thrive, on and off the sidelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are volunteers who wish to serve and lead by example. We support through fundraising, volunteerism, and we stand behind a strong moral character and good sportsmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>We need your help!</strong> The club is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization (EIN 88-2326426) dedicated to supporting the Lane Tech Cheer program. Thanks to the boosters, we are able to fund many essential aspects of the program. These contributions make a tremendous difference for our athletes. Please consider supporting us to keep this program strong!
